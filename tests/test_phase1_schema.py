"""Phase 1 schema invariants.

Locks the multi-tenant integrity guarantees in place after Phase 1's
schema migrations:
- Deleting a user cascades to all owned data.
- Composite FKs make cross-user references structurally impossible.
- The operator seed row exists after migrations.
- Two users can have the same course code (composite PK on (user_id, code)).
