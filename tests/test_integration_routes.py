"""End-to-end integration tests for the routes that aggregate multiple
services. These exist specifically to catch the "forgot to await" class of
bug introduced when migrating callers to async — a missed await would
serialize as a coroutine repr and either 500 or fail a Pydantic shape
check, which is exactly what these tests assert against.

`/api/health` exercises `db.fetchval` + `storage_svc.list_files`.
`/api/dashboard` exercises every list_* service through `dashboard.py`.
