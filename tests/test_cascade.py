"""Cascade-direction regression: deleting a course must cascade to every
table that references it. This locks behavior in before Phase 1
restructures the FK targets to composite (user_id, code).

Note: tasks.course_code is ON DELETE SET NULL (not CASCADE) — tasks are
'personal todos that may or may not belong to a course.' Other tables
CASCADE because they're course-specific by definition.
